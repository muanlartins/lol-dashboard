## Endpoints reference

You can find the swagger with the endpoints [here](https://www.mingweisamuel.com/lcu-schema/tool/#/).

## Test endpoints locally

`C:\Riot Games\League of Legends` is the path for the league of legends folder.
There you will find the `lockfile` file, which contains the following format:

`Process Name : Process ID : Port : Password : Protocol`

The port indicates the `localhost` port, to which we are gonna connect. And the password is part of the authentication necessary, where the username is always `riot`.
